# lora_sdk_test_app

LoraSDK is a Flutter package that enables easy integration of local Large Language Models (LLM) into your Flutter applications. It provides a streamlined interface for managing and running LLM models locally on device.

## Getting Started

For a quick start with our Lora SDK, you can test out a simple example application. Clone the test application repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone "https://github.com/peekaboolabs-appdev/lora-sdk-testapp.git"
```

This repository contains a basic implementation that demonstrates the core functionality of the Lora SDK. It serves as a practical reference for understanding how to integrate and utilize the SDK in your own applications.

After cloning the repository, you can run the test application on both iOS and Android devices using the following Flutter commands:

```bash
cd lora_sdk_test_app
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

You can test the application on both iOS and Android platforms to see the Lora SDK in action. Make sure you have set up your development environment with Flutter and the necessary platform-specific requirements.
